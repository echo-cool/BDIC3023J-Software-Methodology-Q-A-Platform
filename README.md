#### 2.2.5 Problem that may arise

**In the process of using pip to download the package, we have various problems. You can refer to these following information.**

1. If the terminal prompts "Requirement already satisfied: ..." but it cannot find the package we originally installed when running.
* Solution: We need to clear the cache data of PyCharm and reinstall all the packages we need through the "requirements.txt" file.
* And How to Clear the Cache Data: <https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/656db918b1e142a281249cc8.html>
